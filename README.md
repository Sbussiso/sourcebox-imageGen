### Download Images

> After generating an image, you can easily download it to your local device. This allows you to store, share, or use your creations in external projects. Simply click on the ***download icon*** below the generated image, and the file will be saved directly to your computer in its highest available resolution. This feature ensures that you have full access to your images outside the SourceBox platform.

### Regenerate Images

> If an image doesn’t turn out as expected or if you want to explore variations of the same concept, you can use the regenerate feature to create a new version based on the same prompt. By clicking on the regenerate icon under the image, the selected generator will produce a fresh output, allowing you to refine and iterate until you achieve the desired result.
